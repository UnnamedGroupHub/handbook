# Captains

Though "captains" are usually the ones who lead the team, in the context of the Unnamed Esports, they are more of an extension of management and are responsible for the day-to-day operations of the team.

## Responsibilities

- Ensuring the team is ready for matches
- Organizing matches such as scrims, tournaments, and tryouts
- Finding and evaluating new players
- Communicating with management

## How to become a captain

Captains are chosen by management based on their performance and dedication to the team. Sometimes, captains can be chosen by the team itself, if management feels that the team is capable of making that decision.

If you are interested in becoming a captain, please contact management.
