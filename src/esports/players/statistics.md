# Player Statistics

Statistics are a key part of the competitive scene. They allow players to track their progress and see how they can improve. We've developed a system that allows players to submit statistics for each scrim and tournament match they play in, and then view and analyze those statistics in a variety of ways.

**Please note:** Management uses these statistics to determine the performative health of our rosters as well as tracking the progress of individual players. We will never use these statistics to make roster decisions, such as who to cut or who to promote. We will also never use these statistics to determine who gets to play in a match. We will always use our own judgement and analysis to make these sorts of decisions.

## Submitting Statistics

All players are required to submit statistics for each scrim and tournament match they play in. This is done by using the `/player stats submit` command via our bot in the Discord.

The general rule of thumb for when one should submit statistics is whenever the in-game leaderboard (via Tab by default) is going to be reset. This is usually at the end of each map.

## Viewing Statistics

We're currently working on a statistics viewer. In the meantime, you can view your statistics by using the `/player stats view` command via our bot in the Discord to get a general overview of your own statistics.

## Getting Automated Advice

Utilizing a combination of GPT-4 and highly-indexed MongoDB databases, we're able to provide automated advice to players based on their statistics. This advice is provided via the `/player stats advice` command via our bot in the Discord.

Keep in mind that this advice is not always accurate and should be taken with a grain of salt. It is not meant to be a replacement for human analysis, just a supplement to it if you're looking for a quick tip.
