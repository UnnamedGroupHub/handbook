# Terms of Agreement

This document is a non-binding agreement between Unnamed Group administration, Monsoon management, and Monsoon players. It will be updated as necessary and is always the most current version.

In line with Monsoon's [Transparency](./policies/transparency.md) and [Clarity](./policies/clarity.md) policies, it's publicly available with explanations for each term.

All terms can have exceptions and are considered case by case. Our top priority is the well-being of our players and staff.

In this agreement, each article will have an identifier consisting of a timestamp (YYMMDD format) and an issuing number. The timestamp indicates the policy's effective date, while the issuing number differentiates policies from the same day.
